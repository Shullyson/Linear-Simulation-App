The "Linear Simulation" app, a collaborative effort by Sulaiman Waliu, Yazan Hassan, and Mohammed Sule Maidawa under the mentorship of Professor Regis Founier, stands as an advanced tool for conducting linear regression analysis. This research paper delves into the intricate details of the app's development, its robust features, and its profound impact on enhancing comprehension of linear relationships. The app, crafted using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Python for core operations, integrates essential libraries such as NumPy, sci-kit-learn, Tkinter, and Matplotlib. This synthesis empowers users with an immersive and interactive platform, facilitating a nuanced exploration of linear regression dynamics.
